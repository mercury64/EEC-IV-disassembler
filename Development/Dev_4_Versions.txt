4.13.11

change div,norm to double line    (v5).
internal, drop wop and install + 0x40 as write marker (v5).
internal put in new syms find etc to match.




add v5 void* for address as well
put in calc from v5

put in new cmd structure ? maybe later.






4.13.10

1. Fixed - symbol names not correctly showing up on shift instructions
2. Fixed - multibanks using Alt_stackpointer (R22) for background task list can cause freeze/loop due to 
           incorrect list start calculation.

3. Change - continue opcode printing after a 'skip' instead of treating it as a full 'goto'.  






4.13.9

1. Fixed - autoincrement was not showing "++" appended when printing symbol names instead of Rxx style.
2. Fixed - If register declared as an RBASE, writes to it may show an incorrect Register value 
3. Fixed - Code gap scan can cause incorrect register to appear at following opcode

4. Remove check for words and longs on even boundaries. special chips allow this, and also possible in structures.



4.13.8 

1. Fixed - SAD adding offset 'D' internally with a faulty bank reference. Should be no bank, 16 bits.

2. ADD    limited 'gap' scanning for missed code. (reduces manual 'scan' commands).
3. ADD    A check for possible infinite loop in printout. may cause one strange print line. 




4.13.7

1. Fixed - marking data items as 'R' (pointer to) can cause incorrect code scans.
2. Add extra validation check to SYM command (allows multiple colons, should not)





4.13.6

(well this has been something of a bad run since 4.13...)

1. Fixed - incorrect write to ROM address(es) allowed when it should not be. Shows in listing output.
2. Fixed - typo fixing (4.13.5 fix 1) corruptd the result of user 'args'command. 


4.13.5

1. fixed - user commands can get merged with others, and also commands with different data options.
2. fixed - offset option 'D' should print a WORD.  (From 4.13.1 fix 3 and onwards...)  
3. fixed - special sequences in comments ('\s' etc) can run over end of line and print rubbish.

[ 4.13.4 removed because of incorrect fix for offsets]

4.13.3

1. fixed - 'calculated' values appearing with bank when they should not, after symbol name fix.   (From 4.13.1 fix 3) 
2. fixed - Comments appearing but still not in right place, after last comment fix                (From 4.13.1 fix 4)



4.13.2  

1. Fixed - negative values incorrectly displayed as postive in functions and tables.  


4.13.1

1. Add   - Allow options bank (K) and pointer (R) in data items for word, args, subr commands.
2. Add   - add options  / for divide, and * for multiply (both floating point)
 
3. Fixed - Symbol names not appearing.  Caused by incorrect bank handling in print (may not fix all cases yet) - word,args,struct, vect commands
4. Fixed - comments assigned at end of bank (e.g. 1ffff ) do not get printed correctly (or at all). 
5. Fixed - bins with missing bytes at front may not be processed correctly. Added extra checks for end of bank.

6. Change - tighter checks for faulty data or pointers whilst emulating code. 

NOT FIXED - For subroutines which jump into another subroutine (instead of a CALL) arguments occasionally get missed. Still working on this.



 
-------------------------------------------------------------  

4.12

1. Revise address validation (again !!)  For all address inputs in .dir and .cmt files). 
   Final rules are - 
   All addresses are read as up to 5 hex digits, 0xfffff. The first digit is bank. Valid banks are 0,1,8,9 for all bins.
   Registers are 0x0 to 0x3ff (0x0 to 0xff for 8061) Registers cannot have a bank.
   Leading zeroes in register addresses are ignored for compatibility, but not for addresses > 0x2000 in multibanks, as bank 0 is valid.
   
   Single banks (all 8061, some 8065)
      No bank required (i.e. 4 digits). Addresses may have a bank 8 attached, which is not displayed. (Single banks are treated as bank 8 in SAD) 
  
   Multibanks. (8065) 
      0x400 to 0x1fff inputs allowed, and default to Bank 1.   (for compatibility with other tools)
      0x2000 to 0xffff MUST have a bank prefixed.  (0,1,8, or 9)

2. Fixed - Incorrect print layout for 'split comments' ('|' character) and bit names with AND and OR opcodes.
3. Fixed - Comments showing write symbol names ('\S') when they should be read names.
4. Add   - Word tables in .dir commands.     (not detected automatically yet, due soon)

-------------------------------------------------------------  



Note 4.0.7.16  version moved to stable branch as 4.0.7

NOTE - After a HUGE gap, during which I was trying to write a new much neater, much more elegant version (which I can't get to work !)
I decide to go back to the last working version and start over. 
 
Changed to simpler version numbering.

From here I will probably merge in many of those new versions from this attempt.

-------------------------------------------------------------



4.0.11 (10 mar 23)

1. Revert change to 'skip' opcode, which seems to cause several issues

2. change address validation to match other common tools (I hope)

-------------------------------------------------------------

NB.  4.0.10 removed due to another stupid error in address validation

-------------------------------------------------------------


4.0.9

1. Fix regression errors causing symbol names not to be matched correctly in various places in code printout (my error from changes in 4.08)

2. Fix inconsistent spaces in comments after symbol addresses (\S syntax)  

3. Turn off 'gap detect' again as it causes some strange behaviour and user commands to be ignored.



-------------------------------------------------------------

4.0.8  (01 Mar 2023)

Fixed - Inconsistent handling of addresses (bank prefixes) in multibanks across symbols, comments, commands.

NB. I expect probable regression errors as I have changed the whole address verification to use the same routine...

OOPS! I also left on the 'gap detect' from v 4.06 which does work for functions but not so well for tables, and it does produce some
false matches.

-------------------------------------------------------------

Note 4.0.7.16  version moved to stable as 4.0.7 


(dropped older version descriptions)
